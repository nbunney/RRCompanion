# RRCompanion Scraping Deployment Status

## ✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!

The serverless scraping project has been successfully deployed to AWS Lambda in
the `us-west-2` region.

### Deployed Functions

- **`scrapeRisingStarsMain`** - Scrapes the main Rising Stars page (scheduled
  every 6 hours)
- **`scrapeRisingStarsAll`** - Scrapes all genre-specific Rising Stars pages
  (scheduled every 6 hours)
- **`scrapeFiction`** - Scrapes individual fiction details (on-demand)
- **`scrapeFictionHistory`** - Scrapes fiction history data (scheduled every 12
  hours)

### Function Details

All functions are deployed with:

- **Runtime**: Node.js 20.x
- **Memory**: 1-2GB (optimized per function)
- **Timeout**: 5-15 minutes (based on function complexity)
- **Region**: us-west-2
- **Stage**: dev

### Scheduled Functions

The following functions run automatically:

- **Rising Stars Main**: Every 6 hours
- **Rising Stars All**: Every 6 hours
- **Fiction History**: Every 12 hours

### Manual Functions

The following functions can be triggered manually:

- **Fiction Details**: On-demand scraping of individual fictions

## Project Status

✅ **Completed:**

- Serverless project structure created
- TypeScript compilation working
- ESBuild configuration resolved
- Region updated to `us-west-2`
- All scraping code removed from API
- Database service configured for AWS RDS
- SSM permissions resolved
- IAM permissions resolved
- EventBridge permissions resolved
- AWS_REGION environment variable issue resolved
- **AWS Lambda deployment successful**

## Next Steps

1. **Test the functions** to ensure they're working correctly
2. **Monitor the scheduled functions** to verify they're running as expected
3. **Set up monitoring and alerting** for the Lambda functions
4. **Configure environment variables** (DATABASE_URL) in the AWS Console if
   needed

## Architecture Overview

The serverless scraping project includes:

- **Rising Stars Main**: Scrapes the main Rising Stars page (scheduled every 6
  hours)
- **Rising Stars All**: Scrapes all genre-specific Rising Stars pages (scheduled
  every 6 hours)
- **Fiction Details**: Scrapes individual fiction details (on-demand)
- **Fiction History**: Scrapes fiction history data (scheduled every 12 hours)
- **Batch Processing**: Handles Lambda timeout constraints
- **Database Integration**: Connects to existing MySQL RDS instance

All functions are configured with:

- 15-minute timeout (maximum Lambda limit)
- 2GB memory for optimal performance
- Proper error handling and logging
- Graceful timeout management

## Migration Complete

The scraping functionality has been successfully migrated from the Deno API to
AWS Lambda functions. The original API no longer contains any scraping code and
has been cleaned up accordingly.
