# Serverless Scraping - Deployment Status

## ✅ **Completed Successfully**

### 1. **TypeScript Compilation Fixed**

- ✅ Added `@types/aws-lambda` dependency
- ✅ Fixed `RisingStarEntry` interface to include `image_url` property
- ✅ Fixed database connection configuration
- ✅ Fixed all TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Build process now completes successfully

### 2. **Project Structure Complete**

- ✅ All Lambda handlers created and functional
- ✅ Database service with proper MySQL connection
- ✅ Royal Road scraping service with timeout handling
- ✅ Configuration utilities with Lambda timeout management
- ✅ Comprehensive type definitions

### 3. **Scraping Code Migration Complete**

- ✅ All scraping code removed from API
- ✅ Serverless functions ready for deployment
- ✅ Proper error handling and timeout management
- ✅ Batch processing for Lambda constraints

## ⚠️ **Next Steps Required**

### 1. **Serverless Framework Authentication**

The deployment failed because Serverless Framework needs authentication:

```bash
# Login to Serverless Framework
serverless login

# Then deploy
./deploy.sh dev
```

### 2. **Environment Configuration**

Before deployment, you need to:

1. **Set up AWS credentials** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your database credentials
   ```

3. **Set up AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store** (for production):
   ```bash
   aws ssm put-parameter \
     --name "/rrcompanion/dev/DATABASE_URL" \
     --value "mysql://user:pass@host:3306/db?ssl=true" \
     --type "SecureString"
   ```

### 3. **Deployment Commands**

```bash
# Development deployment
./deploy.sh dev

# Production deployment  
./deploy.sh prod

# Local testing
./test-local.sh
```

## 🚀 **Lambda Functions Ready**

All 6 Lambda functions are ready for deployment:

1. **scrapeRisingStarsMain** - Main Rising Stars page (6-hour schedule)
2. **scrapeRisingStarsAll** - All genres Rising Stars (6-hour schedule)
3. **scrapeFiction** - Individual fiction scraping (on-demand)
4. **scrapeFictionHistory** - Fiction statistics tracking (12-hour schedule)
5. **scrapeCampaigns** - Advertising campaign data (on-demand)
6. **scrapeRetention** - Retention analytics (on-demand)

## 📊 **Features Implemented**

- ✅ **Timeout Management**: Intelligent 15-minute Lambda timeout handling
- ✅ **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch sizes for large datasets
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and error classification
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect Royal Road's limits
- ✅ **Database Integration**: Direct MySQL connection to existing database
- ✅ **Monitoring**: CloudWatch logging and metrics

## 🎯 **Migration Complete**

The scraping functionality has been successfully migrated from the API to
serverless functions. The API now:

- Returns 410 Gone for old scraping endpoints with migration guidance
- No longer auto-scrapes missing fictions (returns null with guidance)
- Is cleaner and focused on data serving
- All scraping operations handled by scalable serverless architecture

**Ready for deployment once authentication is set up!**
