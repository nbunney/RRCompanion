# Author Data Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

Some fictions in your database are missing author information (`author_name`,
`author_id`, `author_avatar`). This likely occurred when:

1. Initial scraping failed to extract author data
2. Royal Road page structure caused parsing issues
3. Network errors during the initial scrape

## Solution Provided

I've created a comprehensive solution to fix this issue:

### 1. Check Script (Non-Destructive)

**File:** `check-missing-authors.ts`

This script will scan your database and show you all fictions with missing
author data without making any changes.

**How to run:**

```bash
cd apps/scraping
./run-check-missing-authors.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Queries the database for fictions with missing/empty author names
- Displays a detailed list with Fiction ID, Royal Road ID, Title, and URL
- Shows you the total count of affected fictions

**Use this first** to understand the scope of the problem!

### 2. Fix Script (Updates Database)

**File:** `fix-missing-authors.ts`

This script will re-scrape each fiction with missing author data and update the
database.

**How to run:**

```bash
cd apps/scraping
./run-fix-missing-authors.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Finds all fictions with missing author data
- Re-scrapes each fiction from Royal Road
- Extracts author name, author ID, and author avatar
- Updates the database with the correct information
- Includes rate limiting (1 second delay between requests)
- Provides detailed progress and summary reports

### 3. Database Service Enhancement

**File:** `apps/scraping/src/services/database.ts`

Added a new method `updateFictionAuthor()` to cleanly update author information:

```typescript
await dbService.updateFictionAuthor(fictionId, {
  author_name: "Author Name",
  author_id: "12345",
  author_avatar: "https://...",
});
```

## Files Created

1. **check-missing-authors.ts** - Check for missing authors (safe, read-only)
2. **run-check-missing-authors.sh** - Runner script for the check
3. **fix-missing-authors.ts** - Fix missing authors (updates database)
4. **run-fix-missing-authors.sh** - Runner script for the fix
5. **FIX_AUTHORS_README.md** - Detailed documentation
6. **AUTHOR_FIX_SUMMARY.md** - This summary file

## Recommended Workflow

### Step 1: Check the Scope

```bash
cd apps/scraping
./run-check-missing-authors.sh
```

This will show you how many fictions need fixing and which ones they are.

### Step 2: Review the Output

Look at the list of fictions and verify:

- Are these legitimate fictions that should have authors?
- Check a few URLs manually to confirm they still exist on Royal Road

### Step 3: Run the Fix

```bash
cd apps/scraping
./run-fix-missing-authors.sh
```

This will update all fictions with missing author data.

### Step 4: Verify

Run the check script again to confirm all issues are resolved:

```bash
./run-check-missing-authors.sh
```

You should see: "✅ Great! No fictions with missing author data found!"

## Error Handling

The fix script handles three scenarios:

1. **✅ Success** - Author data found and updated
2. **⚠️ Not Found** - Fiction doesn't exist on Royal Road (deleted/moved)
3. **❌ Failed** - Error during scraping or update

For fictions that are "Not Found", you may want to:

- Remove them from your database, OR
- Mark them with a special status, OR
- Keep them for historical data

## Performance Notes

- **Rate Limiting**: 1 second delay between each fiction
- **Estimated Time**: ~1 second per fiction
  - 10 fictions = ~10 seconds
  - 100 fictions = ~2 minutes
  - 1000 fictions = ~17 minutes

## Safety Features

✅ Uses proper database transactions ✅ Updates only author-related fields ✅
Preserves all other fiction data ✅ Includes error handling for network issues
✅ Rate limiting to avoid IP bans ✅ Detailed logging for debugging

## Future Prevention

To prevent this issue in the future, ensure that:

1. The scraping service properly handles author extraction errors
2. Validation is in place to check for required fields before saving
3. Retry logic exists for failed author extraction
4. Logs are monitored for scraping failures

## Need Help?

If you encounter issues:

1. Check your `.env` file has correct database credentials
2. Verify network access to Royal Road
3. Review the console output for specific error messages
4. Check the scraping service logs for detailed error information

## Cleanup

After successfully fixing all missing authors, you can optionally delete these
files:

- `check-missing-authors.ts`
- `run-check-missing-authors.sh`
- `fix-missing-authors.ts`
- `run-fix-missing-authors.sh`
- `FIX_AUTHORS_README.md`
- `AUTHOR_FIX_SUMMARY.md`

However, you may want to keep them for future use if similar issues arise.

## Technical Details

### Database Query Used

```sql
SELECT id, royalroad_id, title, author_name, author_id, author_avatar
FROM fiction
WHERE author_name IS NULL 
   OR author_name = '' 
   OR author_name = 'Unknown Author'
```

### Update Query

```sql
UPDATE fiction
SET author_name = ?,
    author_id = ?,
    author_avatar = ?,
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = ?
```

### Author Extraction

The scraping service uses multiple methods to extract author data:

1. Finds "by Author Name" text in H4 headers
2. Looks for profile links with `/profile/` URLs
3. Extracts author avatar from profile link images
4. Handles HTML entity decoding
